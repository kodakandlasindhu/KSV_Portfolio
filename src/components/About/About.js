                Hello! My name is <strong>Sindhuvyshnavi Kodakandla</strong>. I'm
                recent Master's graduate in Computer and Information Sciences at 
                University of North Texas,With over three years of experience,
                Iâ€™ve developed a strong ability to analyze complex data and streamline processes, 
                which has consistently contributed to improvements.

              Throughout my career, I have contributed to projects that optimize system 
              performance and elevate user experience, particularly in CRM and Web applications.
              By developing efficient APIs, responsive interfaces, and improving complex SQL operations,
              I've driven measurable improvements, such as enhancing data retrieval speed by 25%
              and reducing code defects by 40%. I have a strong foundation in full-stack development
              and a solid understanding of cloud technologies, enabling me to bridge technical
              and business goals effectively. My focus on high-quality solutions and customer-centric
              development has consistently led to increased customer satisfaction and operational 
              cost savings.
